## [2.1.0] - 2025-11-03 - **ENHANCED CHART DISPLAY & CONNECTION STABILITY** 🎯📡

### 🎉 Major Improvements
**Optimized TradingView Chart Display & Robust WebSocket Connection Management**

This release focuses on perfecting the user experience with enhanced chart visibility and bulletproof connection handling to prevent API rate limits.

### 📊 Chart Display Optimization

#### Full-Width Professional Chart
- **Increased width ratio** from [4, 1] to [6, 1] - Chart now occupies 85% of screen width
- **Increased height** from 600px to 700px for better candle visibility
- **Perfect container filling** - Chart fills 100% of container with no gaps
- **Optimized CSS** - Proper flexbox layout with overflow handling
- **Explicit dimensions** - Changed from autosize to explicit 100% width/height for consistency

#### Technical Implementation
```html
<!-- Optimized container styling -->
.tradingview-widget-container { 
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}
#tradingview_chart {
    height: 100% !important;
    width: 100% !important;
}
```

#### Benefits
- ✅ Candles and indicators clearly visible
- ✅ No wasted whitespace
- ✅ Professional full-width layout
- ✅ Consistent rendering across browsers
- ✅ Better chart interaction area

### 📡 WebSocket Connection Management

#### Connection Limit Protection
**Problem Solved:** Alpaca's free tier connection limits causing "429 connection limit exceeded" errors

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Connection State Tracking** - Added `connecting` flag to prevent simultaneous connection attempts
2. **Proper Cleanup** - Extended wait times (3 seconds) for WebSocket closure
3. **Retry Logic** - 3 attempts with 5-second delays between retries
4. **Connection Buffering** - 2-second buffer between close and new connection
5. **Thread Management** - Proper thread joining with timeout on stop

#### Enhanced Error Handling
```python
# Connection limit specific error handling
except ValueError as e:
    if "connection limit exceeded" in str(e):
        logger.error("⚠️ CONNECTION LIMIT EXCEEDED")
        logger.error("Alpaca's free tier has connection limits.")
        logger.error("Please wait 5-10 minutes before restarting.")
        logger.error("💡 Always use the Stop button before closing!")
```

#### Stop Button Improvements
- **Sequential shutdown** - Stops trading flag first, then closes connections
- **Extended cleanup time** - 3 seconds for WebSocket, 2 seconds for buffer
- **Thread joining** - Waits for background thread to finish (5-second timeout)
- **5-second cooldown** - Prevents immediate restart after stop
- **User feedback** - Clear messages about cleanup progress

#### Start Button Protection
- **Pre-check** - Verifies no existing stream before starting
- **Automatic cleanup** - Closes any lingering connections
- **Connection prevention** - Blocks start if already connecting
- **Better logging** - Detailed connection attempt messages

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

#### Connection Lifecycle
```python
# Before starting new connection:
1. Check if connecting flag is set → exit if true
2. Set connecting flag
3. Close any existing stream (3 sec wait)
4. Buffer period (2 sec wait)
5. Retry loop (3 attempts, 5 sec between)
6. Initialize WebSocket
7. Subscribe to symbols
8. Run stream
9. Finally: cleanup and reset connecting flag
```

#### Error Recovery
- **Graceful degradation** - System doesn't crash on connection errors
- **User-friendly messages** - Plain English error explanations
- **Actionable guidance** - Clear instructions on how to resolve issues
- **Automatic retry** - 3 attempts before giving up
- **State preservation** - Trading state properly reset on errors

### 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

#### Dashboard Layout Changes
- **Unified Control** - Dashboard and Control pages merged into one
- **Removed redundant navigation** - Control page eliminated from sidebar
- **Cleaner navigation** - Only 4 tabs now (Dashboard, Settings, Error Log, Help)

def save_settings():
    try:
        # Save settings logic
        with open('.env', 'w') as f:
            f.write(env_content)
        st.success("Settings saved!")
    except Exception as e:
